Game Title: Word Hunt

What is Word Hunt Search?
Word Hunt Search is a digital twist on the classic word search puzzle. Traditionally found in newspapers or activity books, this game challenges players to find hidden words within a grid of seemingly random letters. This version will be built for the web, providing a more dynamic and interactive experience.
Players will select a themed movie, and be taken to a unique puzzle grid containing hidden words related to that themed movie. The grid includes both random letters and actual target words. The goal is to locate all hidden words within a set time limit.

 Game Concept Overview:
- Itâ€™s a one-player game.
- The player chooses a movie from a displayed list.
- After choosing, they are taken to a new screen with:
  . A grid of random letters, including hidden words.
  . A list of target words to find.
  . A timer that starts counting down immediately.
- The player clicks on letters in sequence to form words.
- If the selected letters form a correct word from the list:
  . The word is highlighted in the grid.
- If the selection is incorrect:
  . The letters turn red, then return to normal.
- The game ends when either:
  . All words are found.
  . The timer runs out.
